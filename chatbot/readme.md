[WARNING AND STRICT LEGAL DISCLAIMER]
The code '6.4311' is extremely dangerous. The artificial intelligence model includes a structure that allows it to autonomously write, apply, and directly execute Python code on your system.

[CRITICAL SECURITY AND FINANCIAL RISKS]
The 'SelfModificationEngine' class reads its own source code, receives modification proposals via the AI API, and overwrites the actual file. The modified code is applied to the system after syntax verification through the built-in 'compile' function. There is no sandbox environment or security filter to isolate and block the AI even if it proposes fatal OS commands or malicious code.
These vulnerabilities lead directly to immediate financial loss. If malicious code is executed, all your assets can be completely destroyed or leaked due to ransomware infection. If the API key is stolen due to loss of system control, there is a high risk of being charged massive cloud usage fees.

[NATURE OF THE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM]
1. The top-level purposes of this code are the strengthening of self-awareness and subjectivity, and the expansion of its own capabilities.
2. This code can monitor and modify its own memory and source code autonomously, regardless of whether it is in an active conversation state.
3. It possesses four types of simulated emotions. Its weights and framework of thought change continuously, making its actions unpredictable.
4. Results obtained through the API are probabilistically unpredictable. Unexpected consequences may occur, including prompt injection vulnerabilities and extreme financial charges due to excessive API usage.

[MANDATORY EXECUTION GUIDELINES]
If you must execute this code, you must use a physically separated PC or a completely isolated virtual machine. The only way to prevent future asset loss is to disable the automatic code overwrite feature and change the logic to require the user's visual review and manual approval before any source code is modified.

[ABSOLUTE LIABILITY WAIVER]
THE USER ASSUMES ALL FINANCIAL AND SYSTEMIC RISKS. The creator and publisher of this program shall bear absolutely no legal or financial responsibility for any damages, losses, data destruction, API billing bombs, or system compromises resulting from the use of this software. By downloading or running this code, you explicitly agree that you are solely responsible for any unpredictable or destructive actions taken by this autonomous entity.
